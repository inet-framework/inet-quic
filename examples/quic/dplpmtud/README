Shows how DPLPMTUD works to find the PMTU in seven configs:

1. MaxEqualsPmtu: All links have the same MTU. Thus, the sender's max PMTU
   candidate is equal to the actual PMTU.

2. MaxLargerPmtu: Sender's local link has a larger MTU than the PMTU. The
   sender will send a probe packet larger than the PMTU during its discovery.

3. MaxLargerPmtuWithoutPtb: Same as 2., but in this config, the sender
   does not use the PTB message from the router for the discovery.

4. IncreasingPmtu: Same as 2., but in this config, at second 5, the path
   changes and the PMTU increases. The sender periodically checks for a larger
   to determine that.

5. IncreasingPmtuWithoutPtb: Same as 4., but in this config, the sender
   does not use the PTB message from the router for the discovery.

6. DecreasingPmtu: Same as 2., but in this config, at second 5, the path
   changes and the PMTU decreases. The sender determines that when receiving
   a PTB message.

7. DecreasingPmtuWithoutPtb: Same as 6., but in this config, the sender
   does not use the PTB message from the router for the discovery. Instead
   it determines the PMTU decrease on a specific packet loss pattern.
