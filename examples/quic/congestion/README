Sender sends as much bytes as congestion control permits. Periodic packet loss 
(set by the packet loss rate p) regulates the congestion window. The network
has a fixed RTT, roughly given by twice the link delay (set by delay variable).
Receiver acknowledges every packet (not only every other).

In this setup, the sender should have a sending behavior in congestion 
avoidance as described by Mathis et. al. [1]. They presented a forumula to
calculate the throughput:

Tp = maxQuicPacketSize / (p * RTT * sqrt(2/(3p))

maxQuicPacketSize is the size of the UDP payload. With the MTU set to 1280 B,
this is 1252 B (1280 B minus 20 B IP header minus 8 B UDP header).

throughput _validation.py reads the results from the simulation, calculates
the achieved throughput by the arrived bytes at the receiver over ten seconds
(with shorter times the calculated throughput depends more on the exact times),
and prints it together with the theoretical throughput given by the formula.
