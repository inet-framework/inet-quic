Example to test 0-RTT connection setup with QUIC. In the first connection, the
server sends a token to the client. In a following-up connection, the client
sends this token in its Initial packet and sends 0-RTT packets with early data
along. Two configs exist to test the bad case.

invalidClientTokenString
Client app provides a malformed token string. QUIC on the client side does not
include a token in its Initial packet and sends the early data together with
the later data in 1-RTT packets. 

sendInvalidToken
Client app provides a correctly formatted token string but changes the token
such that the server will not accept it. Correspondingly, the server discards
0-RTT packets. The client must retransmit the data.
