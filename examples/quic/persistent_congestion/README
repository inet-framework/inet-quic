Simple example to check the reaction to persistent congestion.

A QUIC sender established persistent congestion if it declares all packets
as lost during a specific time frame. To simulate this, the sender sends
data while router2 shuts down for 500 ms. After the outage, the sender
should establish persistent congestion and, as one consequence, reset its
congestion window.
