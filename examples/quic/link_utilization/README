Can a QUIC sender fully utilize the bandwidth of a link?

To check that, the sender sends as many bytes as the congestion control
permits. After some time, the queue of the router before the bottleneck link
is full, and the router has to drop packets. This regulates the sender's
congestion control.

The sender should be able to achieve the maximum throughput, which is:

Tp = quicPacketSize / wirePacketSize * Bw 

where quicPacketSize is the maximum QUIC packet size (i.e., UDP payload size),
wirePacketSize is the maximum packet size on the wire (e.g., including the 
link layer header) and Bw is the bandwidth of the bottleneck link.

One important parameter is the queue size of the router before the bottleneck
link. If it is too small, the sender achieves a smaller throughput. If it is
too large, the queue delay is high. A good value for the queue size is the
Bandwidth-Delay-Product (BDP), where delay actually means RTT.
