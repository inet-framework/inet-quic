Three senders that have to share the bandwidth of one bottleneck link. Sender1
starts sending. After a few seconds, Sender2 and, after a few more, Sender3 
start sending. All three send for a few seconds together before, first Sender1,
then Sender2, and then Sender3 stop sending. A fourth sender generates traffic
to add randomness.

share_validation.py calculates the achieved throughput of all senders every 
100 ms and prints it. The congestion controls have to adjust the throughput
such that each active sender gets a fair share of the available bandwidth.
Thus, the throughput values of active senders should be similar.
