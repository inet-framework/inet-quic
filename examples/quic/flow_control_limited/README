Sender sends as many bytes as flow control permits. Congestion control is
disabled and bandwidth is high enough to not be limiting factors.

When the sender fully used the flow control credit, it has to wait for more
credit, which takes about one RTT before it arrives. This gives the formula
for the goodput.

Gp = fc_credit / RTT

flow_control_validation.py reads the results from the simulation, calculates
the achieved goodput by the arrived bytes from the application at the receiver
over one second, and prints it together with the theoretical goodput given by
the formula.
